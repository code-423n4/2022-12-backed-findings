## Inadequate NatSpec
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec) to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. Please visit the following link for further details:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/natspec-format.html

Here is a contract instance with missing NatSpec in its entirety:

[File: PaprToken.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprToken.sol)

Here is a contract instance partially missing NatSpec:

[File: PaprController.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol)

```
234:    function uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes calldata _data) external {

All internal view and non-view functions
```
## Avoid using abi.encodePacked() when dealing with dynamic types in passing result to keccak256()
As denoted in [Solidity's documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode):

"If you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa. More specifically, abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c"). If you use abi.encodePacked for signatures, authentication or data integrity, make sure to always use the same types and check that at most one of them is dynamic. Unless there is a compelling reason, abi.encode should be preferred."

Consider using `abi.encode()` that will pad item to 32 bytes to prevent hash collision. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()`, it can be cast to `bytes32()` instead. And, if all arguments are strings and/or bytes, bytes.concat() could be used instead.

Here is an instance entailed:

[File: ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.sol#L69-L82](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.sol#L69-L82)

```
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked(
                    "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32",
                    // EIP-712 structured-data hash
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encode(
                            keccak256("Message(bytes32 id,bytes payload,uint256 timestamp)"),
                            oracleInfo.message.id,
                            keccak256(oracleInfo.message.payload),
                            oracleInfo.message.timestamp
                        )
                    )
                )
            ),
```
## `underwritePriceForCollateral()` does not check if ecrecover return value is 0
In `ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.sol`, `underwritePriceForCollateral()` calls the Solidity ecrecover function directly to verify the given signatures.
The return value of ecrecover may be 0, which means the signature is invalid, but the check can be bypassed when signer is 0.

[File: ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.sol#L67-L90](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/ReservoirOracleUnderwriter.sol#L67-L90)

```
  {
        address signerAddress = ecrecover(
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked(
                    "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32",
                    // EIP-712 structured-data hash
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encode(
                            keccak256("Message(bytes32 id,bytes payload,uint256 timestamp)"),
                            oracleInfo.message.id,
                            keccak256(oracleInfo.message.payload),
                            oracleInfo.message.timestamp
                        )
                    )
                )
            ),
            oracleInfo.sig.v,
            oracleInfo.sig.r,
            oracleInfo.sig.s
        );

        if (signerAddress != oracleSigner) {
            revert IncorrectOracleSigner();
        }
```
Consider using the recover function from OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library for signature verification.

Alternatively, the affected code line may be refactored as follows:

```diff
-        if (signerAddress != oracleSigner) {
+        if (signerAddress != oracleSigner || signerAddress == address(0)) {
            revert IncorrectOracleSigner();
        }
```
## Events associated with setter functions
Consider having events associated with setter functions emit both the new and old values instead of just the new value.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: UniswapOracleFundingRateController.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/UniswapOracleFundingRateController.sol)

```
117:        emit SetPool(_pool);

128:        emit SetFundingPeriod(_fundingPeriod);
```
## `papr` over `PaprToken(address(papr))`
`papr` in `PaprController.sol` is already an ERC20 instance inherited from [`UniswapOracleFundingRateController.sol`](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/UniswapOracleFundingRateController.sol#L19). As such casting `papr` into an address type and then reinitializing `PaprToken(address(papr))` is unnecessary.

Here are the instances entailed:

[File: PaprController.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol)

```
387:        PaprToken(address(papr)).burn(address(this), amount);

476:        PaprToken(address(papr)).mint(mintTo, amount);

483:        PaprToken(address(papr)).burn(burnFrom, amount);

540:        PaprToken(address(papr)).burn(address(this), fee);
```
## Immutable variables should be parameterized in the constructor
Consider assigning immutable variables in the constructor via parameter inputs instead of directly assigning them with literal values. If the latter approach is preferred, consider declaring them as constants.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: PaprController.sol#L41-L54](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol#L41-L54)

```
    uint256 public immutable override liquidationAuctionMinSpacing = 2 days;

    /// @inheritdoc IPaprController
    uint256 public immutable override perPeriodAuctionDecayWAD = 0.7e18;

    /// @inheritdoc IPaprController
    uint256 public immutable override auctionDecayPeriod = 1 days;

    /// @inheritdoc IPaprController
    uint256 public immutable override auctionStartPriceMultiplier = 3;

    /// @inheritdoc IPaprController
    /// @dev Set to 10%
    uint256 public immutable override liquidationPenaltyBips = 1000;
```
## Constants should be defined rather than using magic numbers
Consider defining magic numbers to constants, serving to improve code readability and maintainability.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: PaprController.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol)

```
87:            initSqrtRatio = UniswapHelpers.oneToOneSqrtRatio(underlyingONE, 10 ** 18);

89:            initSqrtRatio = UniswapHelpers.oneToOneSqrtRatio(10 ** 18, underlyingONE);

92:        address _pool = UniswapHelpers.deployAndInitPool(address(underlying), address(papr), 10000, initSqrtRatio);
```
## Use `delete` to clear variables
`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. i.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements reset. For structs, it assigns a struct with all members reset. Similarly, it can also be used to set an address to zero address or a boolean to false. It has no effect on whole mappings though (as the keys of mappings may be arbitrary and are generally unknown). However, individual keys and what they map to can be deleted: If `a` is a mapping, then `delete a[x]` will delete the value stored at x.

The delete key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic.

For instance, the `a = 0` instance below may be refactored as follows:

[File: PaprController.sol#L526](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol#L526)

```diff
-            _vaultInfo[auction.nftOwner][auction.auctionAssetContract].latestAuctionStartTime = 0;
+            delete _vaultInfo[auction.nftOwner][auction.auctionAssetContract].latestAuctionStartTime ;
```
## Solmate's contract existence check
As denoted by [File: SafeTransferLib.sol#L9](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9):

```
/// @dev Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.
```
As such, the following token transfers associated with Solmate's `SafeTransferLib.sol`, are performing [low-level calls without confirming contractâ€™s existence that could return success even though no function call was executed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions):

[File: PaprController.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprController.sol)

```
202:            underlying.transfer(params.swapFeeTo, fee);
203:            underlying.transfer(proceedsTo, amountOut - fee);

226:            underlying.transfer(params.swapFeeTo, amountIn * params.swapFeeBips / BIPS_ONE);

253:            underlying.safeTransferFrom(payer, msg.sender, amountToPay);

383:        papr.safeTransferFrom(address(this), to, amount);

514:            underlying.transfer(params.swapFeeTo, fee);
515:            underlying.transfer(proceedsTo, amountOut - fee);

546:            papr.transfer(auction.nftOwner, totalOwed - debtCached);
```
## Minimization of truncation
The number of divisions in an equation should be reduced to minimize truncation frequency, serving to achieve higher precision. And, where deemed fit, comment the code line with the original multiple division arithmetic operation for clarity reason.

For instance, the code line below with two division may be refactored as follows:

[File: UniswapHelpers.sol#L111](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/libraries/UniswapHelpers.sol#L111)

```diff
-        return TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(uint160((token1ONE << 96) / token0ONE)) / 2);
+        return TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(uint160((token1ONE << 96) / (token0ONE * 2));
```
## Non-fungible nature of NFTs
It could be impractical at some point to price all NFTs of a collection with the same floor value considering some of them are going to be worth more than the others. 

A typical scenario would be the NFT under collateral appreciated in price significantly due to multi-factorial reasons, and `debt > max` would not allow the user to redeem it particularly when this constituted the only token in the mapping count. When this happened, a technically savvy user could probably rescue it via an atomic flash loan transaction, but most of the time, the user would be helpless in this type of situation.

Consider implementing a rescue plan catering to this group of users where possible, as according to the whitepaper the protocol seems to be reaching out to the higher end collections of the NFTs that could be prone to this deadlock situation.
