## Inadequate NatSpec
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec) to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. Please visit the following link for further details:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/natspec-format.html

Here are the contract instances with missing NatSpec in its entirety:

[File: PaprToken.sol](https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/PaprToken.sol)

## Unspecific compiler version pragma
The compiler version pragma of [Version.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-forgeries/blob/main/src/utils/Version.sol) is unspecific ^0.8.7. While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

Avoid floating pragmas where possible. It is highly recommend pinning a concrete compiler version (latest without security issues) in at least the top-level “deployed” contracts to make it unambiguous which compiler version is being used. Rule of thumb: a flattened source-unit should have at least one non-floating concrete solidity compiler version pragma.
