# Unused custom errors should be removed
Larger the code base, larger the bytecode will be generated. These bytecode is responsible for total deployment cost. Unused custom errors will only increase the size of bytecode and hence the deployment cost. Its better to remove them if not getting used.

# Use safeTransferFrom for single NFT transfers to save the gas. 
`safeTransferFrom`  are well optimized code, can be used  to save the gas. It is also mentioned on the natspec format, below 
https://github.com/with-backed/papr/blob/9528f2711ff0c1522076b9f93fba13f88d5bd5e6/src/interfaces/IPaprController.sol#L115
But did not really applied in the following code. 
```
    /// @inheritdoc IPaprController
    function addCollateral(IPaprController.Collateral[] calldata collateralArr) external override {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateralArr.length;) {
            _addCollateralToVault(msg.sender, collateralArr[i]);
            collateralArr[i].addr.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), collateralArr[i].id);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

# MerkleProof can be used to avoid high gas consumption in `setAllowedCollateral`

Modifying state by iterating over each and every element of an array is highly gas consuming process and doing for larger number make it worse. 

In future, we might deal with hundred of collateral assets and in order to make them into allowed collateral list, it might exceed the gas limit and get revert.

An efficient call would be implementing Merkle tree whitelisting mechanism. Its saves a lot of gas, and it is easier to implement as well. You only need to submit merkleProof in order to validate the collateralAddr.

# Use of unchecked can save gas where computation is known to be overflow/underflow safe

The codebase already uses the unchecked{} primitive to save gas where computation is known to be overflow/underflow safe. There are a few more places where this can be applied.
