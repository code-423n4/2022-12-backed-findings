#### State variables only set in the constructor should be declared immutable

Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (100 gas) with a PUSH32 (3 gas). If getters are still desired, '_' can be added to the variable name and the getter can be added manually.

`auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad` and `_pricePercentAfterDiscount` can be changed from public to internal or private:
```solidity 
File: src/NFTEDA/extensions/NFTEDAStarterIncentive.sol
72:     function _setCreatorDiscount(uint256 _auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad) internal virtual {
73:         auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad = _auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad;
74:         _pricePercentAfterDiscount = FixedPointMathLib.WAD - _auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad;
75: 
76:         emit SetAuctionCreatorDiscount(_auctionCreatorDiscountPercentWad);
77:     }
```
