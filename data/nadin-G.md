[GAS-01] Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

[GAS-02] Using private rather than public for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

[GAS-03] ADD UNCHECKED {} FOR SUBTRACTIONS WHERE THE OPERANDS CANNOT UNDERFLOW BECAUSE OF A PREVIOUS REQUIRE() OR IF-STATEMENT

[GAS-05] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable
If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are
CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

[GAS-06] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping’s value in a local storage or calldata variable when the value is accessed multiple times, saves ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key’s keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation’s associated stack operations. Caching an array’s struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata

[GAS-07] Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated
Mark data types as calldata instead of memory where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as calldata. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies memory storage.

[GAS-10] STORAGE POINTER TO A STRUCTURE IS CHEAPER THAN COPYING EACH VALUE OF THE STRUCTURE INTO MEMORY, SAME FOR ARRAY AND MAPPING
It may not be obvious, but every time you copy a storage struct/array/mapping to a memory variable, you are literally copying each member by reading it from storage, which is expensive. And when you use the storage keyword, you are just storing a pointer to the storage, which is much cheaper.
