## [G-02] `storage` pointer to a structure is cheaper than copying each value of the structure into `memory`, same for `array` and `mapping`

### Impact

It may not be obvious, but every time you copy a storage `struct/array/mapping` to a `memory` variable, you are literally copying each member by reading it from `storage`, which is expensive. And when you use the `storage` keyword, you are just storing a pointer to the storage, which is much cheaper.

## [G-03] Multiple address/ID mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address/ID to a struct, where appropriate

### Impact

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

## [G-04] Use named returns for local variables where it is possible.

### Impact

It is not necessary to have both a named return and a return statement.
